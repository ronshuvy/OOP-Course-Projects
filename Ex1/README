=============================
As for the Book and Patron classes, the implementation is pretty straightforward.
In Library class,
The books is stored inside array (with capacity of the maximum books capacity).
For that reason, I choosed to define the book's array index as its ID, and thus enjoying access/search
(by ID) in constant time. In addition, I stored the amount of books which currently exist in the library,
to avoid superfluous loop iterations each time we traverse the book list.
The exact same implementation applies for registered patrons.
